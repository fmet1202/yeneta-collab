4. **Upload Materials**: Click the **Paperclip** icon to upload a PDF, Word Doc, PowerPoint, or Image.
5. **Process Documents**: Once uploaded, choose to:
   *   **Explain**: Get a breakdown of the document.
   *   **Summarize**: Get key takeaways and summaries.

## ⚠️ Notes & Limitations

*   **File Size Limit**: To ensure stability on serverless hosting environments (like Vercel), document uploads are capped at **4MB**.
*   **TTS API**: The Text-to-Speech feature currently utilizes an undocumented Microsoft Edge TTS endpoint (`msedge-tts`) to achieve high-quality Amharic voices. While effective, it requires an active internet connection and may be subject to rate limiting by Microsoft.
*   **Browser Compatibility**: Voice recording dynamically falls back to `.mp4` on Safari/iOS and `.webm` on Chrome/Android. Speech Recognition (Dictation) relies on native browser APIs and works best on Chromium-based browsers.
